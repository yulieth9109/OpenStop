version: 0.4.4+14

environment:
  sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"
  # The Flutter version is read in different build scripts and is used to setup the appropriate flutter toolkit.
  # The build processes cannot handle range notations like >=2.17.1 <3.0.0 or ^3.7.0.
  # Therefore it is important to always specify a fixed flutter version in that format: [0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
